We recommend deploying Riak KV on a mainstream Unix-like operating system.
Mainstream distributions have larger support communities, making
solutions to common problems easier to find. 

Basho provides [binary packages][/releases] of Riak KV for the following distributions:

* **Red Hat based:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora Core
* **Debian based:** Debian, Ubuntu
* **Solaris based:** Sun Solaris, OpenSolaris
