In the HTTP standard, a `204 No Content` is returned when the request was successful but there is nothing to return other than HTTP headers.

If you add `returnbody=true` in the `PUT` request, you will receive a `200 OK` and the content you just stored, otherwise you will receive a `204 No Content`.
