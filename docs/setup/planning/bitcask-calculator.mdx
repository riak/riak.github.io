# Bitcask Capacity Calculator

[plan backend bitcask]: /docs/setup/planning/backend/bitcask

These calculators will assist you in sizing your cluster if you plan to
use the default [Bitcask][plan backend bitcask] storage back end.

This page is designed to give you a rough estimate when sizing your
cluster.  The calculations are a _best guess_, and they tend to be a bit
on the conservative side. It's important to include a bit of head room
as well as room for unexpected growth so that if demand exceeds
expectations you'll be able to add more nodes to the cluster and stay
ahead of your requirements.

## Details on Bitcask RAM Calculation

With the above information in mind, the following variables will factor
into your RAM calculation:

| Variable                                 | Description                                                                                                            |
|:-----------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Static Bitcask per-key overhead          | 44.5 bytes per key                                                                                                     |
| Estimated average bucket-plus-key length | The combined number of characters your bucket + keynames will require (on average). We'll assume 1 byte per character. |
| Estimated total objects                  | The total number of key/value pairs your cluster will have when started                                                |
| Replication Value (`n_val`)              | The number of times each key will be replicated when written to Riak (the default is 3)                                |

## The actual equation

Approximate RAM Needed for Bitcask = (static bitcask per key overhead +
estimated average bucket+key length in bytes) * estimate total number of
keys * `n_val`

Example:

* 50,000,000 keys in your cluster to start
* approximately 30 bytes for each bucket+key name
* default `n_val` of 3

The amount of RAM you would need for Bitcask is about **9.78 GBs across
your entire cluster.**

Additionally, Bitcask relies on your operating system's filesystem cache
to deliver high performance reads. So when sizing your cluster, take
this into account and plan on having several more gigabytes of RAM
available for your filesystem cache.
